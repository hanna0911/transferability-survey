%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

abstract = {Cross-domain object detection uses knowledge from source domain tasks to enhance the object detection in target domain. It can reduce the workload of data annotations in the new domain and significantly improve the adaptation ability of the network. We consider a more realistic transfer scenario, that is, our target domain samples cannot be obtained at the same time so that learners cannot forget the old domain knowledge while learning the new domain knowledge, which is consistent with the basic assumption of incremental learning. However, the existing methods do not consider the sequential learning process of the multiple target domains which may cause performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-domain adaptation method for object detection based on incremental learning. Specifically, the incremental learning network saves the knowledge of multiple domains and makes the model to fuse the knowledge of different domains during the training effectively. To make it work better, the progressive training strategy is proposed to make the model gradually adapt to multiple domains. Moreover, we use a multi-level feature alignment module to ensure that domain alignment is realized on features at various levels. We perform experiments on two sets of 6 datasets, which demonstrate that our model can effectively solve the problem of domain knowledge forgetting in multi-target domain adaptation and significantly improve the detection accuracy in each domain.}

abstract = {Applying remote sensing models outside the temporal range of their training data, referred to as temporal model transfer, has become common practice for large area monitoring projects that extrapolate models for hindcasting or forecasting to time periods lacking reference data. However, the development of appropriate validation methods for temporal transfer has lagged behind its rapid adoption. Breaking temporal transfer's assumption of temporal consistency in both remote sensing and reference data and their relationship to each other could lead to biased pixel-level predictions and small area estimators, compromising the operational validity of large area monitoring products. Few studies using temporal transfer have evaluated its effects on model accuracy at the pixel/plot level, and the propensity for biased small area estimators and trends resulting from temporal transfer remains unexplored. We present a framework for evaluating temporal transferability by combining temporal cross-validation with a multiscale map assessment to aid in identifying where and when biased model predictions could scale to small area estimates and affect predicted trends. This validation framework is demonstrated in a case study of annual percent tree canopy cover mapping in Michigan. We tested and compared temporal transferability of random forest models of canopy cover derived from 2010 to 2016 systematic dot-grid photo-interpretations at Forest Inventory and Analysis plots with Landsat spectral indices fit with the LandTrendr temporal segmentation algorithm serving as the primary predictor variables. The temporal cross-validation error (mean RMSE = 13.9% cover) was higher than the common validation approach of considering all time periods of testing data together (RMSE = 13.6% cover) and lower than models trained and tested within the same year (mean RMSE = 14.2% cover). However, the bias of model predictions and small area estimators for individual years was higher with temporal transfer models than when applying models within the same year as their training data. We also evaluated how training models using different temporal subsets and with and without LandTrendr fitting affected predictions of Michigan's 1984–2020 predicted annual mean cover. The mean cover from LandTrendr-based models followed expected and consistent trends and had less difference between models trained with different temporal subsets (max difference = 5.8% cover). While those from Landsat had high interannual variations and greater difference between temporal models (max difference = 11.2% cover). The results of this case study demonstrate that evaluation of temporal transferability is necessary for establishing the operational validity of large area monitoring products, even when using time series algorithms that improve temporal consistency.}

However, PT requires much more training time than fine-tuning. Intuitively, knowledge transfer can help to improve the efficiency. To explore whether we can improve PT via prompt transfer, we empirically investigate the transferability of soft prompts across different downstream tasks and PLMs in this work. We find that (1) in zero-shot setting, trained soft prompts can effectively transfer to similar tasks on the same PLM and also to other PLMs with a cross-model projector trained on similar tasks; (2) when used as initialization, trained soft prompts of similar tasks and projected prompts of other PLMs can significantly accelerate training and also improve the performance of PT. Moreover, to explore what decides prompt transferability, we investigate various transferability indicators and find that the overlapping rate of activated neurons strongly reflects the transferability, which suggests how the prompts stimulate PLMs is essential. Our findings show that prompt transfer is promising for improving PT, and further research shall focus more on prompts{'} stimulation to PLMs. The source code can be obtained from \url{https://github.com/thunlp/Prompt-Transferability}.",

  abstract = 	 {We introduce a new measure to evaluate the transferability of representations learned by classifiers. Our measure, the Log Expected Empirical Prediction (LEEP), is simple and easy to compute: when given a classifier trained on a source data set, it only requires running the target data set through this classifier once. We analyze the properties of LEEP theoretically and demonstrate its effectiveness empirically. Our analysis shows that LEEP can predict the performance and convergence speed of both transfer and meta-transfer learning methods, even for small or imbalanced data. Moreover, LEEP outperforms recently proposed transferability measures such as negative conditional entropy and H scores. Notably, when transferring from ImageNet to CIFAR100, LEEP can achieve up to 30% improvement compared to the best competing method in terms of the correlations with actual transfer accuracy.}
