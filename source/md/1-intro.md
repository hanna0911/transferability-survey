# Introduction

## Existing Reviews

The concept of transferability in machine learning has been extensively explored, yet a unified theory remains elusive due to the diverse definitions and criteria proposed. A comprehensive survey by Pan and Yang examined various transfer learning approaches, highlighting the challenges in defining and measuring transferability {cite:p}`jiang2022transferabilitydeeplearningsurvey`. Jiang presented a survey connecting different areas in deep learning with their relation to transferability, aiming to provide a unified view {cite:p}`zhuang2020comprehensivesurveytransferlearning`. More recently, Xue systematically categorizes and qualitatively analyzes four types of prominent transferability estimation methods, offering insights for selecting appropriate methods {cite:p}`10639517`. These reviews underscore the lack of a singular, universally accepted definition of transferability. 


## Our Contributions

Our contributions can be summarized as follows,

- **A Unified Framework**: We systematically review nine diverse learning paradigms along with transfer learning, and present a unified framework of transferability. 
- **A Comprehensive Survey on Transferablity**: This survey provides a thorough review of methodologies for various transfer learning problems, including out-of-distribution detection (OOD), domain adaptation (DA), and more. We connect these methodologies to offer insights into their interconnections and shared challenges.
- **Future Research Directions**: We conclude the survey with a discussion on open challenges and opportunities for future research, particularly in areas where transferability metrics can be further improved or extended.
